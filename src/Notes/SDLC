SDLC (Software developement Cycle)

Software - a machine readable code or program that tells computers how to perform or do its task
Hardware- is physical like screen, monitors,keyboards & things that you can touch.


SDLC phases
1.Planning - it is marketable, return of investment, probability of achievement and success,is there a demand.


2. Analysis- a business analyst meets w/ clients and takes all the detailed "requirements" which are
fine details of info. they also talk to "end users" about the process that they will be using at the most.
Stakeholders and all the people involved as well as domain experts, coders & developers who have already buildt
a similar code, program or app.


3. Design- designs networks, app architect, user interface, system interface, database, prototypes and system controls.
they are the designers & architect of the project or software being developed.they build the blueprints to support the system
for its primary goals. goals that are current and for the future.


4.Implementation/development-  this is where all the construction workers/ coders start to build. They bring the designed plan
 into life. they also create the database and install the hardware and software to make everything work


 5. Requirement/testing- This is where we come in. we are the inspects  trying to find all the bugs and ways to break the system
 of code so we can send back to the developer to improve and fix the bug. we verify the the coding is good and ready to go


 6.Maintenance- self explained its to maintain and observe the perform for short term to keep it up to date.
